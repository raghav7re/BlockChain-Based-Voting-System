I am currently working on making this project live.
When it will be live i will upload the link here.
It will be done by monday morning.

For a proper project description read the project report in the folder.

# BlockChain-Based-Voting-System

# Abstract

Building a secure electronic voting system that offers the fairness and privacy of current voting schemes, while providing the transparency and privacy offered by electronic systems has been a challenge for a long time.

In this project, we evaluate an application of blockchain as a service to implement distributed electronic voting systems. which improves the security and decreases the cost of hosting a nationwide election.

The purpose of this research project is to develop a decentralized e-voting system that incorporates blockchain technology and encryption to achieve decentralized e-voting without the need for a trusted third party.

The voting process is transparent and public while protecting voter anonymity, the privacy of data transmission, and the verifiable results of the voting..

# Introduction
After every election, EVM has been in the news over the last few years as politicians and activists
have raised questions about the lack of transparency and authenticity of election results. There is
a sense of Question raised on transport without appropriate security of EVM.

Electronic voting machines (EVMs) were supposed to be the cure for the malady of
booth-capturing in elections in India, but in the present form of use, they have only worsened the
problems. Moreover, EVMs also do not meet the legal requirements set out in the Information
Technology Act, 2000.

The duties of the ECI as set out in Article 324 of the Constitution include ensuring that elections
conducted by it are free and fair and reflect the will of the voters. But what is. There can be so
many reasons. One is whether the majority of the country wanted this or the election might be
rigged. To cover this point of perspective we have to come up with a better voting system so that
major citizens of the state/Country can ensure that the candidate they voted for gets elected.
Blockchain can ensure voter anonymity, vote confidentiality and end-to-end verification which
will lead to better efficiency and trustability in the voting system.

Moving to vote online can make the process more comfortable, more flexible, and accessible to
more people. However, the current electronic voting system EVMs and Ballot papers are
vulnerable to data compromise and thus resulting in voting manipulations.
A blockchain can help in addressing these risks. This technology has the potential for enhancing
the security of voters’ personal data, increasing the transparency of the voting process, and
making it easier to verify election results.
WHAT IS BLOCKCHAIN?
The blockchain is a digital ledger that records information in a way that makes it difficult for
hackers to alter. It provides a safe and secure way for individuals to interact directly with each
other without involving third parties like governments, banks, or other institutions. The growing
list of records, called blocks, is linked together using cryptography. Peer-to-peer networks verify
each transaction, which is then time-stamped and added to a chain of data. Once the transaction is
recorded, the data cannot be changed.

BLOCKCHAIN

➢ Block chain is decentralized and distributed technology.
➢ Block chain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or
impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system.
➢ Any transaction or activity done through block chain technology cannot be hacked. Since
the block chain does integrity checks. When an integrity check fails it denies the process.
➢ Block chain achieves Authentication, Authorization, Accounting (AAA).

BLOCKCHAIN STRUCTURE
➤ Every block is connected with the other with the hash value
➤ The last value of the first block and the starting value of the second block should match.
➤ The very first block of the chain is known as genesis block or Oth block

How Blockchain solves voting problems.
Using blockchain, the voting process can be made more secure, transparent, immutable, and
reliable. How? Let’s take an example. Suppose you are an eligible voter who goes to a polling
booth and casts a vote using EVM (Electronic Voting Machine). But since it’s circuitry after all
and if someone tampers with a microchip, you may never know that your vote reaches the person
for whom you voted or was diverted into another candidate’s account? Since there’s no tracing
back of your vote. But, if you use blockchain- it stores everything as a transaction and hence
gives you a receipt of your vote (in the form of a transaction ID) and you can use it to ensure that
your vote has been counted securely.
Suppose a normal digital voting system (website/app) is launched to digitize the process and all
confidential data is stored on a single admin server/machine using SQL. If someone hacks or
spies on it, they can change the candidate's vote count

Background Study
The traditional voting process consists of manual work. In the traditional voting process for
registration, voters have to come along with their national identity cards and have to wait in long
queues for their turn to be verified. After the completion of the voting process, the presiding
officers collect the ballot box and transfer it to the nearby counting centers for voter verification
and counting. and in case of fraud or miscounting, there is no solution.
Then we had the Electronic Voting System(EVM) as the next technology but it had its problem. It
came with a microchip and if someone tampers with a microchip, voters will never know that
their vote reaches the person for whom they voted or was diverted into another candidate’s
account. To solve this issue of trust, our Blockchain-based voting system comes to the rescue. It
uses distributed ledger technology which is stored in every device and is impossible to hack. In it,
transparency will also be retained and counting of voting will also be stored in the blockchain
which also provides fast counting
